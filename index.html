<h2>Jicklus is a good-looking mincraft texture pack; it resembles the Defult pack but has some additional detail and shading. However, the water is my favourite feature; it's much better-looking and gives the pack more realism, but there's still room for improvement and it could be a little bit brighter looking , so I've ranked it Â number five .
